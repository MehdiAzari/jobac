128 in Abjad nummeric system is Hossein (حسین) and 274 in abjad numeric system is Reyahen (ریحانه)

The number 128 does not have a widely recognized significance in Islam, but here are some possible connections:

1. Verse 9:128 in the Quran

Surah At-Tawbah (9:128) is a notable verse where Allah describes Prophet Muhammad's deep concern for his followers:

> "There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. Grievous to him is what you suffer; [he is] concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful." (Quran 9:128)



This verse highlights the Prophet's compassion and dedication to his Ummah.

2. 128th Verse in the Quran

The 128th verse in the Quran, if counted from the beginning, is Surah Al-Baqarah (2:121):

> "Those to whom We have given the Book recite it with its true recital. They [are the ones who] believe in it. And whoever disbelieves in it—it is they who will be the losers." (Quran 2:121)



3. 128 in Islamic Numerology

Islamic numerology (Abjad system) assigns values to Arabic letters, but 128 does not have a well-known symbolic meaning. However, breaking it down:

1 (Tawhid – Oneness of God)

2 (Duality – life & afterlife)

8 (Balance, justice)
